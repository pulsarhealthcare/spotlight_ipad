      <h2>The nature of generic prescribing means that<br>
          alternating versions of medicines from different<br>
          suppliers may be dispensed and that there is therefore<br>
          no continuity of product for the patient</h2>

      <h3>By prescribing Spotlight products by brand, every time
      patients<br>
      collect a new prescription from the pharmacy
      they will be<br> 
      dispensed the same brand in the same
      packaging.* This ensures<br>
      continuity (compared to
      generic prescribing) which is associated<br>
      with:</h3>

      <ul>
          <li><h3>Reassurance for the patient</h3></li>
          <li><h3>Compliance benefits</h3></li>
          <li><h3> Lesslikelihood of dispensing errors going unnoticed as patient<br>is familiar with appearance
                            </h3></li>
