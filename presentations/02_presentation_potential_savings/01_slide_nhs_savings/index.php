        <p>†Note: due to strict guidance that transplant patients
                                should not be switched between brands of ciclosporin
                                without careful therapeutic monitoring, all
                                calculations for the size of the ciclosporin market
                                (volume and value) and the associated savings that
                                Capsorin can deliver are only associated with non
                                transplant indications</p>

        <p>‡Savings will be lower in NHS Scotland due to lower
                                generic reimbursement of fentanyl transdermal patches,
                                isosorbide mononitrate 60 mg XL tablets and
                                eicosapentaenoic acid/docasahexaenoic acid capsules

                                Advance is taken at half the dose of
                                Gaviscon/Peptac,<br />
                                therefore savings are calculated against twice the
