    <h1>Potential Spotlight cost savings<sup>1</sup></h1>             

<h2>Marol costs approximately 61% less than
                                Zydol<sup>®</sup>
                                (tramadol SR 100 mg, 150 mg and 200 mg), which could
                                deliver costs savings of up to £22.24 (200 mg, 60 pack
                                size) per prescription. At a Primary Care Organisation
                                (PCO) level, this translates into a potential average annual saving of</h2><h2>over £63,061<sup>1</sup></h2>
