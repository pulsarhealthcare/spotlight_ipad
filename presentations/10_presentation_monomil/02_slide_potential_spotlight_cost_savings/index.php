    <h1>Potential Spotlight cost savings<sup>1†</sup></h1>           

<h2>Monomil<sup>®</sup> costs approximately 67% less than Imdur<sup>®</sup>
(isosorbide mononitrate XL 60 mg) which could
deliver costs savings of up to £7.01 (28 pack size)
per prescription. Furthermore, Monomil costs 67%
less (England and Wales) than prescribing
isosorbide mononitrate XL 60 mg tablets
generically.*† At a Primary Care Organisation (PCO)
level, this translates into a potential average
<span>annual saving of over £46,984<sup>1</sup></span></h2>
