    <h1>Potential Spotlight cost savings<sup>1</sup></h1>             


<h2>
Capsorin<sup>®</sup>
costs approximately 33% less than
Neoral<sup>>®</sup>
(ciclosporin 100 mg), which could deliver cost savings
of up to £23.68 (100 mg, 30 pack size) per
prescription. At a Primary Care Organisation (PCO)
level, Capsorin offers potential average annual savings
of over £13,564
