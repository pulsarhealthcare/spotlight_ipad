Capsorin<sup>®</sup>
costs approximately 33% less than
Neoral<sup>®</sup>
(ciclosporin 100 mg), which could deliver cost savings
of up to £23.68 (100 mg, 30 pack size) per
prescription. At a Primary Care Organisation (PCO)
level, this translates into a potential average annual
saving of <span>over £13,564<sup>1</sup></span>

</h2>


<h3>All products that contain ciclosporin should be
                                prescribed by brand name to minimise the risk of
                                inadvertent switching between brands, and to reflect
                                advice in the <span>British National Formulary<sup>2</sup></span></h3>



<h3>Brands of ciclosporin are not considered
                                interchangeable without careful therapeutic monitoring.
                                If switching a patient stabilised to one brand of
                                ciclosporin is unavoidable, the patient should be
                                closely monitored for side effects, ciclosporin drug
                                blood concentrations, serum <span>creatinine levels, blood
                                pressure, and transplant function<sup>2</sup></span></h3>



<h3>Transfer from one ciclosporin product to another does not <span>require dose adjustment in the first
                                instance<sup>2</sup></span></h3>
