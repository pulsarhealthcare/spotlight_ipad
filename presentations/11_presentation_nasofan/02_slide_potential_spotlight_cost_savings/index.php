    <h1>Potential Spotlight cost savings<sup>1</sup></h1>           

<h2>Nasofan<sup>®</sup>
costs approximately 27% less than
Flixonase<sup>®</sup>
(fluticasone aqueous 50 mcg nasal spray), or
prescribing fluticasone aqueous 50 mcg nasal spray
generically,* which could deliver costs savings of up
to £2.97 (150 dose presentation) per prescription. At a
Primary Care Organisation <span>(PCO) level, this translates
into a potential average annual saving of over
£14,532<sup>1</sup></span>
