      <h1>What is the Spotlight portfolio?</h1>

      <h2>The Spotlight portfolio is a small group of products selected by Teva UK Limited that endeavour to fulfil certain criteria, for example they must:</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>
            <h3>Costs</h3>
            <h4>Offer potential cost savings to prescribers</h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Reimbursement</h3>
            <h4>Be reimbursed via Category C in the Drug Tariff in
                England and Wales, not be listed in the Drug Tariff, or
                able to generate significant savings versus other
                brands. Teva UK Limited differentiates the pricing of
                its Spotlight products against competitor products in
                order to deliver potential cost savings directly to
                prescribers, Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG), NHS
                Board, Local Health Board (LHB), Health and Social Care
                Trusts and the NHS. In some instances, Drug Tariff in
                Scotland reflects different reimbursement prices.</h4>

      <ul>
          <li>
            <h3>Active Ingredients</h3>

            <h4>Have packaging of the same/similar standard to the
            brand originators (for example, if the brand is in a
            calendar pack, the Spotlight product should be in a
            calendar pack)</h4>
