<h2>Matrifen<sup>®</sup>
costs approximately 40% less than
Durogesic<sup>®</span></sup>
DTrans<sup>®</span></sup>
(fentanyl 12 mcg/hr, 25 mcg/hr, 50 mcg/hr, 75 mcg/hr
and 100 mcg/hr transdermal patch), which could deliver
cost savings of up to £23.27 (100 mcg/hr 5 pack size)
per prescription. Furthermore, Matrifen costs 40% less
(England and Wales) than prescribing fentanyl 12
mcg/hr, 25 mcg/hr, 50 mcg/hr, 75 mcg/hr and 100 mcg/hr
generically.* At a Primary Care Organisation (PCO)
level, this translates into a <span>potential average annual
saving of over £66,196<sup>1</sup></span>

<h2>NICE recommends that transdermal opioid patches
with the lowest acquisition cost should be
considered for patients with stable analgesic
requirements for when oral <span>opioids are not
suitable<sup>2</sup></span></h2>
